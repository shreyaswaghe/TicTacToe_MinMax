# TicTacToe

This is a Python3/pygame based unbeatable TicTacToe game against an optimal AI-based agent.

The code may be found at this <a href = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R3NGOnAun_WB28TAp2pJQW5dT2LpGip7?> Google Drive link </a>. This is a restricted folder, and as such, I will not be granting general access to it. Please contact me at ***swaghe(at)umass(dot)edu*** for access.

This project was developed as a part of the coursework for CS50AI - CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence using Python from HarvardX/EdX. 
The agent uses a Minmax based searching algorithm to find the best possible play(s) for a given board setup.

To work on in the future:
  1. Add alpha-beta pruning to make decision making efficient.
  2. Add difficulty levels, making the game not completely unbeatable.

I am committed to the <a href = https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/honesty> CS50 Academic Honesty Policy</a>. In line with the policy, I cannot make this code available to a current or prospective student of CS50AI.

If you are here looking for a solution to the project, please keep in mind that _"searching for or soliciting outright solutions to assessments online or elsewhere"_ is also a violation of the academic honesty policy.

I can, however, provide you with an executable distribution for the game.

**THE EXECUTABLE ONLY WORKS ON MACOS SINCE I USED PYINSTALLER ON MY DEVICE**

To run:
1. Download the package through git.
 -> Use ```git clone https://github.com/shreyaswaghe/TicTacToe_MinMax``` in a desired folder.
 -> Download straight from https://github.com/shreyaswaghe/TicTacToe_MinMax
 
2. Run ```
